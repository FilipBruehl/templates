# Task Templates

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/codefreak/templates.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#codefreak/templates)

These are the task templates for [Code FREAK](https://github.com/codefreak/codefreak). They are available in the user interface under **Task Pool** â†’ **Create Task**. You can also take a look at the code here to get started with task definition files.

Contribution is welcome. **Please open issues in the [main repository](https://github.com/codefreak/codefreak).**

## Development

After changing something in this repository, you have to create a new tag in the [releases](https://github.com/codefreak/templates/releases) section. The templates are automatically packaged into a jar by JitPack. You then have to adjust the `com.github.codefreak:templates` dependency version in the [build.gradle](https://github.com/codefreak/codefreak/blob/master/build.gradle) of the main repository accordingly.
