  # C++ Task Example
  This is basic C++ task to get you started quickly with Code FREAK.
  To turn this into a useful programming exercise, you have to do the following.
  ## Provide Code to Students
  If you do not want your students to start completely from scratch, provide some scaffolding code. Look into  `include/` and `src/` for some inspiration.
  ## Setup Automatic Evaluation
  This example comes with two pre-configured evaluation steps. You can see them in the _Evaluation_ tab. To try it out, enter _testing mode_ and start the evaluation.
  ### Static Code Analysis
  The tool [Code Climate](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate) is used to provide your students with tips on how to write better code. It is configured via `.codeclimate.yml` in the task files. See [official documentation](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/advanced-configuration) for details.
  ### Unit Tests
  Unit tests are your main instrument for automatically validating your students' answers. To get started, look into `tests/` for example test cases.
  There are many unit testing frameworks for C++. This example uses [`Catch2`](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). See Catch's documentation how to write unit tests.
